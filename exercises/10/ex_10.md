# Exercise 10


### Part A

Run the following Docker image:

`docker run -p 8080:8080 -t arcuri82/tk2100-chat`


Such web application represents a simple chat program based on WebSockets.

Open such web page from 2 *different* browsers (e.g., Chrome and Firefox),
best if from 2 different machines (e.g., another laptop or a mobile connected
to the same WiFi).

From the 2 browsers, do some chatting (actual content of messages does not matter)
to see that the chat is working properly.


### Part B

From Chrome Developer Tools, look at the JavaScript code used to update the page
with the most recent messages. It is not important that  you do not understand
how WebSockets are used here, but, however, look at how the code to generate the HTML
for messages is written. 
Such code is vulnerable to XSS attacks. Why?

Craft a chat message which execute JavaScript code. 
Such code should replace the entire content of the disaplyed web application with
an image of your choice, like a Jolly Roger.

 When such message is sent, everyone using the chat program should get such image
 covering the entire page, and with the functionalities of the chat not working
 any more (i.e., no possibility to send new messages).
